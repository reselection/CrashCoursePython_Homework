# CrashCoursePython_Homework
Homework i made for CrashCourse Python second edition 

The code isn't well documented and some pieces are missing for now.

Update:
I finished chapter 9, and i feel like its quite well documented but it can be better.
I may do projects later, Django looks very interesting and so does the data project.

If you're picking the code and see something odd, please let me know!
Thanks for checking out my code.
